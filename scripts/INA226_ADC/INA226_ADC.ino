/*
This scripts allows usage of INA226's shunt resistor voltage measurement ADC for any
high resolution voltage measurement application thanks to its high bit range (16 bit),
from -81.9175 to 81.92 mV fixed (according to datasheet).

It is assumed that INA226 doesn't have any shunt resistor connected to IN+ and IN- inputs.
